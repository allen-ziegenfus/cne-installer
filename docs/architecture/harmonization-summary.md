# Harmonization Strategy & Feature Matrix

## Executive Summary: Alignment Overview
The GCP and AWS implementations for Liferay Cloud Native are **architecturally aligned (~80%)** but **operationally divergent**. Both platforms share a core foundation based on **Crossplane**, **ArgoCD**, and the **Kubernetes Gateway API**. 

The primary differences stem from:
1.  **Platform Constraints**: GKE Autopilot's strict admission control requires manual CRD management for Gateway API, whereas AWS EKS is more permissive.
2.  **Configuration Philosophy**: The GCP implementation is more **modular and descriptive** (e.g., granular Crossplane compositions, detailed Artifact Registry policies), while the AWS implementation is more **monolithic and automated** (e.g., single-file compositions, direct OCI chart consumption).
3.  **Maturity Levels**: The AWS team is currently ahead in Helm chart versioning (`0.3.0` vs `0.1.6`) and standardized tagging, while the GCP team has a more feature-rich ArgoCD platform setup (SSO, UI Tools).

## 3. Compliance & Architectural Standards

### 3.1 Brand Integrity (ArgoCD)
The project adheres to strict **Brand Integrity** rules established by project leadership. Standardizing on `argocd` (identifiers) and `ArgoCD` (text) ensures consistency across both AWS and GCP implementations.

*   **Core Mandate:** GEMINI.md (Section 3: Brand Integrity)
*   **Alignment:** AWS team implementation (standardizing on `argocd` without underscores).

This ensures that the GCP implementation is not only technically functional but also architecturally compliant with the project's brand and naming conventions across all cloud providers.

## 4. Harmonization TODO List

### Priority 1: GitOps & Reliability (Immediate)
- [ ] **Adopt Sync-Waves**: Update all GCP resources (Gateway, EnvoyProxy, Compositions) to use the AWS standard sync-wave tiering (e.g., `-110` for infra, `-30` for gateway).
- [ ] **Standardize Tags**: Implement `function-tag-manager` in GCP Crossplane compositions to ensure the `DeploymentName` label is consistently applied to all cloud resources.
- [ ] **Namespace Consistency**: Ensure ArgoCD is installed in the same namespace across both clouds (align on either `argocd` or `argocd`).

### Priority 2: Security & Portability (Short-term)
- [ ] **Real IP Support**: Implement `GCPGatewayPolicy` (or equivalent) in the `gateway-infra` chart to mirror the AWS `ClientTrafficPolicy` for ProxyProtocol support.
- [ ] **EKS Secrets Encryption**: Align GCP with the AWS standard by explicitly configuring Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for GKE ETCD secrets.
- [ ] **Property Abstraction**: Update `liferay-gcp` to use the AWS-style `$[env:VAR]` pattern for all dynamic properties in `portal-ext.properties`.

### Priority 3: Refactoring & Maintenance (Long-term)
- [ ] **Version Synchronization**: Perform a manual audit of `liferay-default:0.3.0` (AWS) and port all logic improvements to the GCP version.
- [ ] **OCI Orchestration**: Evaluate moving the `gateway-infra` and `liferay-gcp` charts to direct OCI consumption in Terraform, eliminating the "local wrapper" maintenance overhead where Autopilot allows.
- [ ] **ASCII Sort Audit**: Perform a project-wide linting pass to ensure all variables and locals are sorted by ASCII value as per `GEMINI.md`.

## Conclusion
Harmonizing these two environments will provide a "Single Pane of Glass" experience for administrators and developers, regardless of the underlying cloud provider. By adopting the AWS team's naming and tagging standards while exporting GCP's platform richness (SSO/UI Tools), we can achieve a truly world-class multi-cloud infrastructure.
